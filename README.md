# NOTES
### making changes ask these questions:
- is it a profound or cosmetic change? big or visual? 
- where could the change be implemented?
- is there something like this already? 


### othere ideas TODO:
- let the user set the priority status when creating the todo Item 
- let users filter or sort by priority status
- expand the priority feature to have more than 2 levels
- add a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos
- add colors, so people can associate different todos with each other
- add labels for sorting and filtering
